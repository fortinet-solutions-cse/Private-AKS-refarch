# CLI with the provided docker image

This section assume you already run:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/fortinet-solutions-cse/secured-AKS-refarch
cd secured-AKS-refarch
```

## Run with the provided Docker image with all cli installed
```shell
docker run -v $PWD:/Azure/  -i --name az-aks-cli  -h az-aks-cli -t fortinetsolutioncse/az-aks-cli
```

Type the rest of the commands in a shell inside this docker runtime.

## optionnal
If like me you have internal SSL inspection you use the same image.
(Curious check the code).

```shell
export FGTCA=$(base64 Fortinet_CA_SSL.cer -b0)
# this is for MacOS use -w0 on Linux
docker run -v $PWD:/Azure/ -e FGTCA -i --name az-aks-cli  -h az-aks-cli -t fortinetsolutioncse/az-aks-cli
```

# Fortigate and networks
You can customize region and name of the resource group if necessary (shared accounts for example). You must be able to manage service principals

Warning if you want to effectively change region you must update region parameter in myparameters.json file

```shell
az login
export GROUP_NAME="ftnt-demo-aks"
export REGION="westeurope"
./Step1-FortigateAndNetworks.sh
```
This deploy a single fortigate VM with predefined setup. To login to the fortigate use fgtadmin/Fortin3t-aks.

It can be replaced by a more advanced Fortigate in HA, scalable transit etc..
Depends on Fortinet generic blueprint : https://github.com/fortinet/azure-templates

# AKS/ACR architecture 
```shell
export GROUP_NAME="ftnt-demo-aks"
export REGION="westeurope"
./Step2-PrivateAKS.sh 
```

This second part has been kept in a small script and readable commands so that you can check the differents steps and options by yourself more easily.


This deploy a jumphost VM in the transit area for convenience. 
A AKS with the following options:

- enable-private-cluster 
- network-plugin azure 
- generate-ssh-keys
- outbound-type userDefinedRouting

The result is a fully private setup (API and nodes) and ensuring there is firewall observability and prevention on outbound an inter-nodes traffic.

## Fortigate setup
Apply configuration to the FGT.
Replace the IP with the public IP of your fortigate. You may need to retry if experiencing a timeout.
```shell
ansible-playbook fgt-playbook.yaml -i hosts -e ansible_host=52.174.188.48
```


## VPN to Fortigate

The Fortigate has been setup (Ansible) to accept a VPN IpSec to the environment. (recommended)
Setup Forticlient IPSec client on your laptop with the public IP of the Fortigate:

- psk: Fortin3t-aks
- user: aks
- password: Fortin3t-aks

![ScreenShot](images/FortiClient-screenshot.png)

# Access the environment

Kubectl commands should work after this stage.

# Use AKS

Try to run kubectl commands:
```shell
kubectl cluster-info
```

If returning information you are good to go for the hands on demos part.
It is an supported AKS so you can also follow [AKS Tutorial](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/tutorial-kubernetes-prepare-app)

# Optionnal 

## add Windows based nodepool

```shell
export GROUP_NAME="ftnt-demo-aks"
export REGION="westeurope"
./Step3-WindowsNodes.sh
```

## Use Lens

Thanks to the vpn you can direclty and easily use [Lens](https://k8slens.dev/) directly on you laptop.

# Cleaning

Remove the resource group on the portal or:
```shell
az group delete -g $GROUP_NAME -y
```
